                    <p>Hello world, Healthy greetings to all of us. My name is Ahmad Rayhan, and I am a Information Systems student at Airlangga University. 
                        I have a passion and interest in the world of technology and business in depth. 
                        <br> <br>
                        I have been active and involved in various academic and non-academic 
                        activities. I once made a website-based car rental application design project using the laravel framework. I can use the courses studied such as 
                        Website and Mobile Programming, Databases, System Analysis and Design to Machine Learning so that they can support and hone the various skills needed.                        
                        <br> <br>
                        In addition, I was once a member of HIMSI 2022 and is currently an active member of the Department of Social and Environment BEM FST 2023, was the 
                        chief executive officer of the FST 2023 Village Development Program at the faculty level, HIMSI 2022 community service field coordinator at the study 
                        program level, as well as various other student activities.
                        <br>
                        Until now I have a strong spirit and determination to be able to pursue all targets in order to improve my quality and abilities.
